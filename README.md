## Application

The purpose of this exercise is to build an application based on the provided mockups and requirements below.
You may choose to use Angular, Vue, React, Svelte or Stencil.
Brownie points if you choose Svelte or Stencil. :)

### Should I include tests?

It's up to you depending on what you consider "done" and the amount of time you have at your disposal.

### Quiz App

The application is a Quiz interface - a UI that shows a set of questions and lets the user select an answer for each one.

The Quiz features three different types of questions. Use the included mockups as references for styling.

**Multiple**  
A multiple-choice question (predefined answer options)

**Boolean**  
A "true or false" only answer question

**Text**  
An open-ended text question

### Requirements

1. The UI should fetch the questions data from an API (provided in this repository). More details in [API instructions](#api-instructions)

2. The application should display one question per time, randomly selected from the set of questions. It should display at least 5 questions.

3. When the user finishes the Quiz, the UI should display a summary page with the results, including:

- Number of correct answers
- Number of incorrect answers
- Total number of questions answered
- The final score (%)
- A button to restart the Quiz with a different questions

A reference mockup for the summary page is depicted below:

### API instructions

This repository provides a basic API (running under port 4000) that returns the required data for the application.

#### GET Questions List
